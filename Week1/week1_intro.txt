DevOps is a culture, a set of practices, and a collection of tools that brings together software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams to deliver applications and services faster and more reliably through collaboration and automation. It focuses on breaking down traditional silos, enabling continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), and fostering a mindset of shared responsibility and continuous improvement throughout the entire software lifecycle.
